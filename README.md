## Description

 Internet retail, also known as **e-commerce**, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes.

 In this application I built the back end for an e-commerce site and configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

  I used to insomnia to check/ test the api was working correctly by testing:
  * GET routes for all categories, all products, and all tags.
  * GET routes for a single category, a single product, and a single tag.
  * POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for categories, products, and tags

  ```md
  AS A manager at an internet retail company
  I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
  SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
  ```
